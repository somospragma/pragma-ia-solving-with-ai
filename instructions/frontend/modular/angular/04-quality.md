# Quality & Engineering Excellence

## 4.1. Testing Strategy & Implementation

## 4.2. Quality Gates & Acceptance Criteria

## 4.3. Error Handling & Validation

**Error Handling and Validation:**

- Use proper error handling in services and components
- Use custom error types or factories
- Implement Angular form validation or custom validators

## 4.4. Security & Compliance

### 4.4.1. Data Protection

**Security:**

- Prevent XSS with Angular's sanitization; avoid using innerHTML
- Sanitize dynamic content with built-in tools
- Avoid writing console.log statements to prevent information disclosure

### 4.4.2. Compliance Requirements

## 4.5. Performance & Optimization

**Performance Optimization:**

- Optimize *ngFor with trackBy functions
- Use pure pipes for expensive computations
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation; use Angular's templating system
- Optimize rendering performance by deferring non-essential views
- Use Angular's signals system to manage state efficiently and reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Use the NgOptimizedImage directive to enhance image loading and performance
- Avoid computed properties (e.g. get prop() { }) when accessing variables from a HTML view. Prefer signals or observables
- Unsubscribe from observables using Angular lifecycle ngOnDestroy if there are not clean-up automatically
- Utilize deferrable views for optimizing component rendering, deferring non-critical views until necessary

**Web Vitals:**

- Focus on optimizing Web Vitals like LCP, INP, and CLS

## 4.6. Accessibility (A11Y)

- Ensure accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
