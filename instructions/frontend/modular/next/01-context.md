# General Context

## 1.1. Project Context

This is a Next.js project using the modern **App Router** (`app/` directory) architecture. Use the `app/` directory for all new projects. Prefer it over the legacy `pages/` directory.

## 1.2. Technology Stack

## 1.3. Custom Project Sections

**Always use the latest documentation and guides:**

- For every Next.js related request, begin by searching for the most current Next.js documentation, guides, and examples.
- Use the following tools to fetch and search documentation if they are available:
  - `resolve_library_id` to resolve the package/library name in the docs.
  - `get_library_docs` for up to date documentation.

**Avoid Unnecessary Example Files:**
Do not create example/demo files (like ModalExample.tsx) in the main codebase unless the user specifically requests a live example, Storybook story, or explicit documentation component. Keep the repository clean and production-focused by default.
