## 4.1. Testing Strategy & Implementation

- **Test Coverage Requirements:** Maintain minimum test coverage of 80% across the application
- **Testing:** Use Jest, React Testing Library, or Playwright. Write tests for all critical logic and components.
- **Co-locate tests with components** (e.g., `UserCard.test.tsx`).

## 4.2. Quality Gates & Acceptance Criteria

## 4.3. Error Handling & Validation

## 4.5. Performance & Optimization

**Performance Optimization:**

- Use built-in Image and Font optimization with modern formats for images (WebP, AVIF)
- Apply minification and obfuscation for CSS and JavaScript files in production builds
- Use Suspense and loading states for async data
- Avoid large client bundles; keep most logic in Server Components

## 4.6. Accessibility (A11Y)
