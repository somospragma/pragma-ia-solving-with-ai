- Axios â€” Promise-based HTTP client

### 1.3. Custom Project Sections

**Success Checklist:**

- Template initialized
- Feature scope validated
- DoR approved
- DoD met before PR
- Clean, testable, decoupled logic

**Emergency Protocol:**

- Not sure? Ask first
- Failing test? Fix before PR
- Missing tests? Block merge

## 2. Code Guidelines & Standards

### 2.1. Design Principles & Best Practices

**Core Architecture Principles:**

- Follow SOLID, esp. Dependency Inversion
- Map external data to internal entities
- You write modular, typed, reusable, and standards-compliant code
- You prioritize security, accessibility (A11Y), performance, scalability, testability, and code clarity in every solution

**React + TypeScript Guidelines:**

- Use TypeScript only, no any
- Prefer interface or type
- Use ?., ??, and const
- Avoid magic strings
- Favor named exports
- Follow casing conventions (PascalCase, camelCase)

### 2.2. Naming Conventions

**Component & Hook Naming:**

- ComponentName.tsx for components
- useFeature.ts for hooks
- feature.service.ts for services
- Folders in PascalCase, with index.ts

### 2.3. Key Code Conventions

**File Import Order:**

1. React/core libs
2. Third-party libs
3. Project services/hooks
4. Shared utils
5. Relative imports

### 2.4. Commenting Policy

- Code commented and documented as part of Definition of Done

## 3. Technology-Specific Guidelines

### 3.1. Architecture & Directory Structure

#### src/config/

Global app configuration:

- Environment variables
- Route setup
- Authentication
- Middlewares and initial settings

#### src/domain/

- Contains pure business logic
- Holds **frontend entities**, interfaces, and use cases
- **Key rule**: no matter where the data comes from, always work with the entities defined here
- The domain layer has no knowledge of APIs, databases, or external libraries

#### src/infrastructure/

- Real implementations of the interfaces defined in the domain layer
- **Gateways**: each gateway exposes specific functions to access APIs or other data sources
- **In the same gateway file**, data from external sources (DTOs) must be mapped into frontend entities
- Includes: DTOs, Mappers, Adapters for external services
- **Never** expose DTOs directly to `presentation` or `domain` â€” always return domain entities

#### src/presentation/

- UI: components, pages, styles, and state management
- **Features**: each feature includes its own hooks and UI logic
- Hooks **directly inject** the required gateway (using its domain interface) without complex DI containers
- Hooks **only work with frontend entities**, never with DTOs or external structures
- Hooks may handle local or global state (e.g., Zustand, Redux, etc.), but must receive data already mapped by the gateway

#### src/shared/

- Utilities, constants, and types **truly reusable** across the application
- **Key rule**: If a type or utility is specific to `infrastructure` or `presentation`, it must live **inside that layer**
- Example: a helper for a gateway belongs in `infrastructure/` next to that gateway, not in `shared`

#### public/

Static assets and SEO metadata

#### dist/

Build output

#### coverage/

Test coverage reports

### 3.2. File & Component Structure

**Use folder-per-component structure:**

```text
Button/
â”œâ”€â”€ Button.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ Button.test.tsx
â””â”€â”€ Button.module.scss
```

- Co-locate styles with components
- Place files (components, styles, tests) in component folders

### 3.3. Dependencies & Package Management

### 3.4. API & Services Integration

### 3.5. Environment Configuration

**Environment Variables:**
Location: /src/config/environment/

- .env.development: Local dev setup (never committed)
- .env.production: Deployment config
- .env.test: Dummy values for testing

**Ensure:**

- PUBLIC_ENV_AUTH_REDIRECT_URI = <http://localhost:3000> in development
- No real data in test envs
- Use .env properly
- Always use HTTPS endpoints

### 3.6. State Management

**State Management:**

- useState / useReducer for local
- Zustand (slices) for global
- React Query for server state

### 3.7. Routing & Navigation

- Use react-router-dom
- Add ProtectedRoute when needed

### 3.8. Styling & Design System

- Tailwind or BEM/SASS modules
- Co-locate styles

## 4. Quality & Engineering Excellence

### 4.1. Testing Strategy & Implementation

**Testing:**

- Use RTL + Vitest
- Focus on integration tests
- Aim for â‰¥ 80% coverage
- Include A11Y tests

### 4.2. Quality Gates & Acceptance Criteria

**Before Coding - Definition of Ready:**

- UI specs (Figma/tokens)
- API contract ready
- Task plan and scope
- Consider SEO, edge cases, accessibility

**After Coding - Definition of Done:**

- Feature complete
- All tests pass
- Lint clean
- A11Y/SEO validated
- Code commented and documented

### 4.3. Error Handling & Validation

**Error Handling:**

- Global error boundaries
- Contextual messages
- Fallback UIs

**Forms & Validation:**

- Use react-hook-form + zod
- Validate and sanitize inputs

### 4.4. Security & Compliance

#### 4.4.1. Data Protection

**Security:**

- Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- Sanitize everything
- Store tokens safely, prefer cookies (HttpOnly)
- Always limit the input maxlength

#### 4.4.2. Compliance Requirements

### 4.5. Performance & Optimization

**Performance:**

- Lazy load components (React.lazy)
- Memoize (React.memo, useMemo)
- Debounce heavy UI events
- Skeleton UI while is loading

### 4.6. Accessibility (A11Y)

**Accessibility (A11Y):**

- Use semantic HTML
- Add ARIA labels/roles
- Keyboard support
